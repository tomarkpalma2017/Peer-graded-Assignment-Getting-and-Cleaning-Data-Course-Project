This readme explains how the rscript was run that eventually cleaned the  initial dataset.

2. Retrieve the figures regarding the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Use the most descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.

#5: From the newly created data set (CleanData), creates another tidy data set containing the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
CleanDataFinal.txt is the resulting data set.

CodeBook.md contains the descriptions needed to understand the dataset in layman's term in the simplest way I can
